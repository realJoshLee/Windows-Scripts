# Windows Scripts
These scripts where developed for Windows 10, they may work on older Windows versions but haven't been tested. Some of these scripts are meant to be used for a domain enrolled computer and the rest of them can be used for both domain enrolled and not domain enrolled computers.

## Use
Just download the script(s), edit the script(s) if needed, and then run the script(s).

## Exporting Scripts
Anything in the 'ExportScripts' folder will export the the contents to a file on the users desktop with the username followed by the command. This can be configured to place the exported files onto a file share server.

There are 2 different scripts to be ran in that folder even though there are 3 differnt files in the folder. The scripts that can be ran are:
- Device-Info.bat
- RUN-DNS-Route.ps1

If you want to use the RUN-DNS-Route.ps1 file, just make sure that you download the DNS-Route.ps1 file as well.
